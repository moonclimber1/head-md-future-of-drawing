Today I did different preperations for the testing day.

- I built the interaction plate by using a wood plate and painting it with pencil graphite. Screws for a better conductive connection.
- Coding of the Spring movement (Combination of Touchdesigner and Node js, communication over OSC)
- Preparing my research questions for the testing.
