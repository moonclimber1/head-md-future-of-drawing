Morning Appointment with Frederic in the atelier prototypage for the CNC. He will be able to produce the object but unfortunately only short before the presentations.



## CNC Specifications

- 4cm maximum piece height
- 4cm means a minimum radius of 3mm when doing concave edges
- I will have to cut my object into pieces, as the CNC only works on 3 axis
- 12mm distance between objects, 5mm to the edges
- Max working area 1000mm x 500mm

- one round drilling tool and one flat tool
- if its only on the surface its possible to work with thinner tools

**Hêtre - Beechwod**

**Frêne - Ashwood**

After some comparison I decided to go with ashwood (beechwood as a backup If they dont have enough) Together with beechwood its the cheapest of the hard wood and has a nicer look and better stability than spruce wood.
