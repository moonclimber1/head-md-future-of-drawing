Today we had 3D classes with Laure. Next to learning the new 3D softwares I improved my prototype and added an Max Msp sketch to synthesize sounds based on the resistance measurement of the pencil. I tested the prototype with a few persons of our class. 

## User Testings

**Feedback**
- interesting interaction, makes fun to play with
- sound is too annoying with time and does not have enough changement yet
- no reaction to pencil position yet

**Conclusions**
- Interesting path, interaction is generally working, but I have to go again more into the concept. I want to research more into the topic of musical and metaphorical resonance.
