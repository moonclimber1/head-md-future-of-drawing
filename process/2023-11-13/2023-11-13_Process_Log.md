Today: Input with Laure, Brainstorming and discussions

After some discussion wth fellow students I feel the urge to revise my concept / experience again.

It might be more interesteing to focus on graphite as material in general instead of envisioning it in the form of a pencil.

Maybe create special analoge drawing devices that dont look an feel like penclis, maybe use eraser instead.

Maybe drawing with a pencil is too rigid for this contemplative experience, maybe graphite powder could be more interesting.
