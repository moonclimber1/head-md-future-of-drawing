Today we had an soldering introduction with Pierre.

I started to research into how I can electronically amplify my measured signals to be able to measure with greater precision. For the amplification I need so called operational amplifieres (either simple gain configuration or used as a difference amplifier).

With the help of Pierre I was able to design a first amplification circuit in Fritzing as well as on my breadboard.

I use an LM358P integrated circuit for the amplification.
